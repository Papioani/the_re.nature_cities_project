        Re.Nature Cities aims to evaluate via experimental and simulation means
        the ability of street trees as nature-based solutions (NBS) to act as an
        effective measure against the increased air temperature on the ambient
        and indoor environment, thermal discomfort, air pollution, and energy
        costs caused by climate change, while promoting public health and the
        well-being of the citizens.
